## Remaining Placeholder Links

These links remain as placeholders (`href="#"`) as they would typically require backend functionality or are demo-only:

1. **Account Settings** - Would require user profile backend
2. **Forgot Password** - Would require email/auth backend
3. **Create Account** - Would require registration backend
4. **Download/Export buttons** - Would generate actual files
5. **Live Chat** - Would require chat integration
6. **Payment processing** - Would require payment gateway

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the navigation flow from login → course discovery → enrollment → checkout
2. Verify all instructor portal sections load correctly
3. Check all admin dashboard sections display properly
4. Test FAQ accordion functionality in Help Center
5. Verify Terms of Service anchor links work

## Next Steps

1. Connect placeholder buttons to actual backend functionality
2. Implement real search functionality in Help Center
3. Add actual chart visualizations in Analytics section
4. Create additional legal pages (Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy)
5. Implement real-time chat support

All navigation links now either:
- Navigate to actual content
- Perform their intended function
- Are clearly marked as demo placeholders requiring backend integration
