3. **Interaction Testing**
   - Touch gestures

## Outstanding Considerations

1. **Images**: All images use responsive techniques but actual image files would benefit from:
   - Multiple resolutions (srcset)
   - WebP format support
   - Lazy loading implementation

2. **Performance**: Consider implementing:
   - Critical CSS inlining
   - JavaScript bundling
   - Service worker for offline support

3. **Testing**: Recommend:
   - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
   - Real device testing beyond emulators
   - Performance audits with Lighthouse

## Conclusion

All pages in the CPR Training Hub application are now fully responsive and mobile-first. The application provides an optimal viewing and interaction experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
