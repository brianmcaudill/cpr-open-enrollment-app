# Executive Summary

This project seeks to build and develop a custom-built CPR open enrollment web

application front end and back end. The goal is to create a

centralized, instructor-friendly, scalable system that supports class scheduling, student

registration, payment processing, and certification issuance—while leveraging AI to

enhance automation, analytics, and personalization.

On the front-end side, the application will include three to four tailored variants

designed to support different user roles or use cases (e.g., embedded, master calendar,

student portal, ecommerce), ensuring a streamlined and context-appropriate experience

for each.


This RFI will be used to identify a development team who can deliver a scalable
platform that is cost effective solution that aligns to the overall goal.





# Objective

This project is designed to go beyond current market offerings like Enrollware,

HOVN, CPREnroll, and Classbyte, which lack centralized calendars and AI features. By

incorporating user flexibility, intelligent tools, and a robust administrative portal tailored

for CPR training businesses, the platform creates unmatched value for educators and

organizations. It empowers in-house teams to efficiently manage scheduling, records,

instructor coordination, and other critical operations — all in one streamlined interface.



## Master calendar (four variants) visible to students, filterable by zip code, city, state,

class type, and date.

- Training centers and instructors can create/list classes, visible in both their local

calendars and the centralized master calendar.

- Merchant services integration for secure online payments (e.g.

Stripe/PayPal/Zelle/Venmo).

- Training center billing/invoice dashboard.

- SMS and email reminders and confirmations for students.

- Mobile (HTML 5) check-off module for skills verification during classes.

- Real time API digital certification issued upon completion.

- Dashboards with access to rosters, student history, E-Card history, and uploaded

documents.

- Centralized admin control panel.

- Admin dashboard with access to all platform data, KPIs, and operational oversight.

- Students have their own portal to access class history, certifications, and upcoming

registrations.

- Controlled customization for instructors' calendar views and optional class landing

pages.

- Option to embed calendar directly into an instructor's personal site via iframe or

JavaScript.

- This Open Enrollment build core application will help TSMS schedule/assign their

instructors to their classes. This would work like our training scheduling system.



## Advanced Enhancements & Competitive Features:

- Affiliate and referral tracking for instructors and training centers to promote the

platform.

- Automated compliance alerts for certification expirations and renewal reminders.

- On-demand microlearning tools for students, including pre-class refreshers and

post-class quizzes.

- White-labeling capabilities for enterprise clients to use their own branding.

- Live class streaming or hybrid tools for flexible instruction and broader student

reach.

- External API/Webhook integration.



## AI Integration Opportunities:

- Intelligent agent for student support.

- Smart scheduling suggestions for instructors based on patterns and demand.

- AI-powered analytics for performance trends, pass rates, and instructor feedback.

- Personal learning paths and class reminders for students.

- Forecasting, automation, and fraud detection in admin operations.



## Adoption-Boosting Features:

- Quick-start onboarding wizards for instructors and training centers.

- Free trial or freemium tier for class postings and student registrations.

- Review and rating system for instructors and classes.

- Mobile-responsive platform or lightweight app for convenient access.

- Calendar sync with Google, Outlook, and roster export options.

- Community resource center with training content, guides, and forums.

- Badging and gamification to recognize top instructors, students, and businesses.



## Technology Stack (Core Features)

### Front-End:

- Modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (UI): Preference for

React.js (v18+) for dynamic, scalable user interfaces (e.g., student portal, master

calendar). Alternatives like Vue.js, Angular, or Svelte may be proposed with
justification for performance and alignment.

- Responsive styling system.

- Server-side rendering and dynamic page generation for SEO.

- State management for handling user and application data.



### Back-End:

PostgreSQL for scalable management of users, classes, schedules, and payments

with geospatial support. Alternatives like MySQL may be proposed with

justification.
